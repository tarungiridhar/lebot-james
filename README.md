# lebot-james
A discord bot that adds a bit of fun to your server in the style of LeBron James with Lebron themed messages and references.

Sends either a message mentioning a server member or a poll open to everyone randomly between one minute and 12 hours.
There are 20 unique LeBron style messages that can be sent and 11 LeBron style polls that can be sent. The poll responses also are LeBron styled.

The bot can be invited to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1362649377176551464), where it is hosted off of my PC.
If you want to host it yourself, you can create a Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), clone the repo, install the requirements.txt, and provide your application's token key in a .env file with the key named TOKEN.
